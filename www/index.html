<h1>Demo API Server</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the <tt>php-grades-rs</tt> Demo API Server. The code can be 
found at <a href="https://github.com/fkooman/php-grades-rs">https://github.com/fkooman/php-grades-rs</a>.
</p>

<h1>API Documentation</h1>
<p>
All requests to this service need to have the <tt>Authorization</tt> header
provided and the client needs to have the <tt>grades</tt> scope in order to be
allowed to request grades.
</p>

<p>
The Authorization <tt>Bearer</tt> token can be obtained through the OAuth 
Authorization Server.
</p>

<h2>Request Grades</h2>

<p>
There are two ways to request grades:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the identifier of the student;</li>
  <li>Using the <tt>@me</tt> special identifier.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Only the <tt>GET</tt> request method is supported.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
Here the explicit user identifier is specified. Please not that this 
identifier needs to match the identifier of the user who authorized the client.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer ABCDEF" http://localhost/php-grades-rs/api.php/grades/bmcatee
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 05 Oct 2012 11:48:51 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Unix) DAV/2 PHP/5.3.15 with Suhosin-Patch mod_ssl/2.2.22 OpenSSL/0.9.8r

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here the explicit user identifier is replaced by the <tt>@me</tt> resource 
which will just be replaced internally by the actual user identifier that 
authorized the client.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer ABCDEF" http://localhost/php-grades-rs/api.php/grades/@me

<h2>Entitlement</h2>
<p>
For some users there can be additional permissions. There are two more API calls:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A <tt>GET</tt> request to <tt>/api.php/grades/</tt> (note the trailing slash) listing all students that have grades;</li>
<li>A <tt>GET</tt> request to <tt>/api.php/grades/someotheruser</tt> listing grades for any student that has grades;</li>
</ol>

The response format of getting a list of students is like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer FEDCBA" http://localhost/php-grades-rs/api.php/grades/      
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 05 Oct 2012 11:51:32 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Unix) DAV/2 PHP/5.3.15 with Suhosin-Patch mod_ssl/2.2.22 OpenSSL/0.9.8r
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.15
Content-Length: 83
Content-Type: application/json

[{"id":"bmcatee"},{"id":"jmatson"},{"id":"jstroud"},{"id":"mcram"},{"id":"mwisdom"}]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
These calls require the <tt>urn:x-oauth:entitlement:administration</tt> entitlement and should be configured in the OAuth Authorization Server.
</p>

<h2>Errors</h2>
<p>
There are a number of errors that can be triggered, to list a few:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You request a resource you are not allowed to access;</li>
    <li>You request a resource that does not exist, i.e.: student has no registered grades;</li>
    <li>The client did not get the <tt>grades</tt> scope and thus is not allowed to request grades;</li>
</ul>
<p>For example requesting a resource to which you do not have any access:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer ABCDEF" http://localhost/php-grades-rs/api.php/grades/someotheruser
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
